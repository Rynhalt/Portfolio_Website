# üßô AGENT.md ‚Äî Development Manifesto for Rynhalt.github.io

## üß≠ Project Overview
**Rynhalt.github.io** is a personal portfolio that blends **modern design principles** with **retro JRPG aesthetics** inspired by the *Dragon Quest* series.  
It should feel immersive, story-driven, and nostalgic ‚Äî while remaining performant, accessible, and cleanly engineered.

The site serves as:
- A professional portfolio (projects, experience, and contact info).  
- A creative expression of identity ‚Äî combining technical precision and playful nostalgia.  
- A codebase that demonstrates proficiency with modern frameworks, TypeScript, and UI motion design.

---

## üé® Experience Goals
- ‚öîÔ∏è Blend **modern polish** and **retro charm**.  
- üß≠ Two distinct modes:
  - **Modern Mode:** Scrollable, responsive layout with project panels, animations, and media.  
  - **Quest Mode:** Interactive experience where a pixel-art hero walks along a path and projects appear as ‚Äúquests.‚Äù  
- üí´ Transitions should be smooth, responsive, and light (60 FPS target).  
- ü™Ñ Performance and usability always take priority over heavy graphics.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
**Framework:** Next.js 14+ (TypeScript)  
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom pixel-border utilities  
**Animation:** Framer Motion (Modern Mode), PixiJS / Canvas API / React Three Fiber (Quest Mode)  
**Fonts:**  
- Primary ‚Äî *Inter* (modern readability)  
- Accent ‚Äî *Press Start 2P* (retro pixel headings)  
**Deployment:** Vercel  
**Optional:** Howler.js for background or ambient audio

Avoid:
- Large 3D engines (e.g. Babylon.js, Three.js physics) unless justified.  
- Generic UI kits that conflict with the pixel aesthetic.

## üß± Design System

### Colors
| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|--------|
| Royal Blue | `#1E2A78` | primary background |
| Gold | `#F4D03F` | accents, borders, highlights |
| Silver | `#C0C0C0` | secondary text or frames |
| Parchment | `#F8F6F2` | background for light mode |
| Ink Black | `#222222` | main text |

### Layout & Style Rules
- Use **flex** or **grid** layouts with clear spacing.  
- Minimum section padding: `3rem 0`.  
- Cards, buttons, and modals should feature **pixel borders** and **gold glow** on hover.  
- Use subtle easing for all transitions (`easeInOut`, 200‚Äì400 ms).  
- Hero text should mimic RPG ‚Äúdialog boxes‚Äù ‚Äî box-shadow or frame borders.  
- Keep the overall tone *adventurous yet professional.*

## üß© Project Data Schema

```ts
// src/data/projects.ts
export interface Project {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  tech: string[];
  emoji?: string;
  image?: string;
  link?: string;
  type: "system" | "ai" | "web" | "hackathon" | "robotics";
}
````

All components that render projects should consume this schema.

## üìÅ Recommended Directory Structure

```
src/
  app/
    layout.tsx
    page.tsx
  components/
    Navbar.tsx
    HeroSection.tsx
    ProjectPanel.tsx
    QuestMode/
      RpgScene.tsx
      HeroSprite.tsx
  data/
    projects.ts
  styles/
    globals.css
  utils/
    animations.ts

  audio/
```

## üíª Code Style Guide

* Use **TypeScript** with explicit interfaces and props.
* Keep components under 150 lines where possible.
* Use **Tailwind CSS** classes, avoid inline styles except for dynamic motion props.
* Always include comments for animation logic and Canvas rendering.
* Maintain semantic HTML and accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard support).
* Commit messages should be action-based (`feat:`, `fix:`, `style:` etc.).

---

## ü™Ñ Interaction Guidelines

* Player sprite and motion logic should live in isolated components (no global state pollution).
* In **Quest Mode**, use lightweight physics and smooth transitions ‚Äî think SNES overworld, not open world.
* In **Modern Mode**, project panels should fade or slide into view via Framer Motion scroll triggers.
* Audio is opt-in (muted by default) and can be toggled from a small floating control.

## üìú Commands Codex Should Understand

Codex or any code-generation assistant may receive prompts like:

| Intent           | Example Command                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add component    | ‚ÄúCreate a `ProjectCard` component that renders project data with pixel borders and hover glow.‚Äù |
| Animate motion   | ‚ÄúAdd Framer Motion fade-in for project panels on scroll.‚Äù                                       |
| Quest mode logic | ‚ÄúMake the hero sprite walk along a 5-tile path and display each project as a dialog box.‚Äù       |
| Theme extension  | ‚ÄúAdd Tailwind plugin for pixel-border utilities.‚Äù                                               |
| Layout           | ‚ÄúImplement scroll snapping between main sections (Intro ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Contact).‚Äù                 |

All outputs should comply with this document‚Äôs design and code style guidelines.

## üîÆ Tone & Philosophy

> *‚ÄòSimplicity is elegance, and nostalgia is power.‚Äô*
> This project should show technical depth without clutter. Every pixel, transition, and line of code should serve clarity, personality, or performance.

Would you like me to follow up with a **starter `Next.js` project scaffold** (preconfigured with Tailwind, fonts, and the pixel theme described here) so you can immediately drop this `AGENT.md` in and start building?
